# Over view of the package

In this blog I will review "vietnamcovid19" package created by Hanh Ngo. This package can be found from [Github](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-HanseNgo305) with a [pkgdown website](https://etc5523-2020.github.io/r-package-assessment-HanseNgo305/). The goal of _vietnamcovid19_ is to provide a simple dashboard to report the situation of Covid-19 in Vietnam from the January 2020 to October 2020.

# What did I think this package would do?

* I expected
1. Successfully download from git hub.
2. Launch_app can find and load shiny application.
3. One function that refactors one part of the user interface side logic of the Shiny app.
4. One function that refactors one part of the server-side logic of the Shiny app.
5. Contains the necessary data to run the Shiny app, and the data can be explored by the user.
